Shell scripting in Linux refers to the process of creating and running scripts written in a 
shell scripting language, such as Bash (Bourne Again SHell). A shell script is a series of 
commands and instructions written in a text file that the shell (command-line interpreter) 
executes sequentially. These scripts allow users to automate tasks, perform system operations, 
and manipulate data without needing to interact with the command-line interface manually each
time.
In simpler terms, shell scripting involves writing a set of commands that a user wants the
computer to execute, and these commands are saved in a script file. When the script is run, 
the shell reads and interprets each command in the file, executing them one by one.
Shell scripting is powerful because it can combine various Linux commands, control structures
(like loops and conditionals), variables, and user input to create customized and efficient
solutions for different tasks, ranging from simple file manipulation to complex system 
administration tasks.
Overall, shell scripting is a fundamental skill for Linux users and administrators, as it 
allows them to automate repetitive tasks, manage system resources, and streamline various 
operations.
